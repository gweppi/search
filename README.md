# search (Gwep Search)

Theo from T3 made his own kinda search engine that included the bangs from DuckDuckGo (!yt leads to Youtube, !a to amazon etc.)
He said he made it in half an hour and also said it reminded him of how good of a programmer he was. 
So I did the same hahaha.

Inspired by [this](https://youtu.be/_DnNzRaBWUU) video.

To use, change your search engine to `https://search.gwep.dev?q=%s` in your browser settings.
